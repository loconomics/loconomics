# Template for creating all personas
_Source: Alexander Cowan_
A certain **PERSONA** exists ... and they have a certain **PROBLEM(S)** ... where they're currently using certain **ALTERNATIVE(S)** ... and Loconomics has a **VALUE PROPOSITION** that's better enough than the alternatives to cause the persona to join our cooperative.

**V**ivid
**A**ctionable
**R**eal
**I**dentifiable
**E**xact
**D**etailed

## Personas - Thinks, Sees, Fees, Does
Problem Scenario | 
------------ |

**Sees:** The interactions that shape their thinking - media, peers, education, training, casual observation. _[In certain situation] [person] sees [key observation of importance]. [Repeat, etc]_ | 
**Feels:** The emotional driver. What emotions around the relevant activity? What trigger emotions? Results? _When [some event], persona feels [emotion]. It's [cause] that make them feel this way._ | 
**Does:** The 'actuals'. What triggers? How often? For how long? How much money? _[Persona] [does activity] [x] times per [period]. Persona spends [$z] on [area] per [period]._ |

### Is this an invest-able story?
_Source: Bill Wake on XP123_
- [ ] **Independent:** Could this be implemented on a stand-alone basis or does it presuppose other content?
- [ ] **Negotiable:** Stories are _not_ spec's. This is an input for you to arrive at an optimal implementation with the developer, not a functional 'requirement'
- [ ] **Valuable:** What problem scenario does this address? How have you validated your value proposition for it?
- [ ] **Estimable:** How hard is this vs. the team's experience? Is it discrete enough?
- [ ] **Small:** A big part of what makes agile (and lean) work is the use of small batches with measurable results. Make sure your stories are broken down to workable sizes.
- [ ] **Testable:** How will you know if it's working in a way where you can validate its value?
