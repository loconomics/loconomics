    Log-in a user creating a session and returning the authentication
    key for further API requests.

    TODO Review the output redirectUrl, is needed this info? Is not used on mobile, and that will replace everything in UI, remove it I think

    - POST:
        - username:string
        - password:string
        - returnProfile:bool ask to return the basic profile data on the result, in the key "profile"

    - return: code 400 with validation errors or object
        {
            "redirectUrl": "suggested URL to redirect the user, like pointing to an onboarding step",
            "userId": 100,
            "authKey": "authentication key to hold in session and send on further API request to detect the session",
            "profile": null // Object with a copy of the user basic profile data if requested with returnProfile param
        }

    EXAMPLES {
        "Login"': {
            "url": "/api/v1/en-US/login",
            "post": {

                 "returnProfile": false,
                 "api comment": "Param returnProfile allows to return a 'profile' property with the user profile data (table [users]). The returned 'redirectUrl' on success must be mandatory when there is a value since sometimes will be different from the given 'redirect', as for service professionals in the Onboarding, they must continue that at the step given in 'redirectUrl'. This is the fact for current Website, what rules we will manage on mobile?."
