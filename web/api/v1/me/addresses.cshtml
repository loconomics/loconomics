    Addresses API: addresses organized by Kind of address for the logged user.

    Kind:
        /home
        /billing
        /service

    The kind string-flag is attached to the address info as read-only for any of that types.

    Under each, different sets of addresses are managed, the single home address, the personal
    billing addresses (when booking a service professional, as client), and the service addresses
    attached to a Job Title. Service addresses can be attached to the special JobTitleID:0, that
    means is a client address where a servicie is performed by other user (the service professional).

    Technical back-end notes: Current database scheme is two tables for addresses, generic address and service specific address details.
    It's more complex than need to be (see issue #677), so in the API is treated as a unique, flat table,
    but keeping the two primary keys scheme of the [service-address] table (addressID and jobTitleID) to avoid breakage for the
    time the two tables scheme is keep on database and any old data that has duplicated addressID
    on service-addresses for several jobTitleID (formerly positionID).
    Here the address structure is considered like a single table where the few service specific fields are only
    used when kind=service, validation applies only on that cases, on any other kind those include default false/null values and discarded
    if included in an update or creation.

    ### API
    /addresses/service/:jobTitleID
        - GET: list all the addresses attached to the Job Title. Kind=service

        - POST: create a new address for the Job Title.
            - addressName:string REQUIRED For the special 'home' address is not editable but needs a value to be sent,
                                    internally keeps being 'Home' discarding incoming value.
            - addressLine1:string OPTIONAL-IF:isServiceArea=1
            - addressLine2:string OPTIONAL
            - postalCode:string REQUIRED Public Postal Code, internally translated to postalCodeID and computes City and StateProvinceID,
                                it uses too the current CountryID (per API call).
            - latitude:float OPTIONAL
            - longitud:float OPTIONAL
            - specialInstructions:string OPTIONAL
            - isServiceLocation:bool NOTE:For kind=service addresses, one of both fields (isServiceLocation and isServiceArea) must
                                        to be set as 1:true. A job title address cannot exists without almost one flag.
            - isServiceArea:bool NOTE: see isServiceLocation note.
            - serviceRadius:decimal NOTE: Required to be greater than zero if isServiceArea is set to 1:true.

    /addresses/:jobTitleID/:addressID
        - GET: single address.

        - PUT: update an address for the Job Title. Same fields as POSTing a new address with the addition of:
            - updatedDate:datetime Optional for now, in future to check for update collisions.

        - DELETE: deletes the address. If the address is internally linked, will be soft deleted.

    /addresses/home
        - GET: get the home address (single, permanent -ever exists-). Kind=home
        - PUT: update the home address. Fields as described in service addresses but without the service specific
            fields (isServiceLocation, isServiceArea, serviceRadius)

    /addresses/billing
        - GET: get a list of personal billing addresses. Kind=billing
        - POST: create a new billing address. Fields as described in service addresses but without the service specific
            fields (isServiceLocation, isServiceArea, serviceRadius)

    /addresses/billing/:addressID
        - GET: single address

        - PUT: Update a billing address. Same fields as in POST.

        - DELETE: deletes the address. If the address is internally linked, will be soft deleted.

    ### Structures
        address {
            addressID:int Auto
            jobTitleID:int
            userID:int
            addressName:string Auto-per-case Editable-per-case
            addressLine1:string Editable
            addressLine2:string Editable
            postalCode:string Editable Note:internally is stored as postalCodeID, performing a lookup, but transparent to the API
            city:string Auto Note:is assigned and stored with an automatic internal lookup per postalCodeID
            stateProvinceCode:string Computed Note:internally is stored as stateProvinceID, performing a lookup with the postalCodeID,
                                        but this field shows the country official CODE that represents the entity (its a short string, usually 2 uppercase letters)
            stateProvinceName:string Computed Note:internally is stored as stateProvinceID, performing a lookup with the postalCodeID,
                                        but this field shows the country official NAME that represents the entity in the local language
            countryCode:string Computed Note:internally is stored as countryID, based on API-call/user-country and is used along with Postal Code for lookups.
                                        It shows the international code for the country (ISO 3 letters, uppercase).
            latitude:float Editable Note:if not specified, can be calculated server-side using Geolocation where possible.
            longitude:float Editable Note:if not specified, can be calculated server-side using Geolocation where possible.
            specialInstructions:string Editable
            isServiceLocation:bool Editable Flag marking the address as a location where services are performed.
            isServiceArea:bool Editable Flag marking the address as the reference point for an area where the service professional travels to performa services.
            serviceRadius:decimal Editable Only required if isServiceArea has value 1:true. Sets the approximate distance of the service area (in miles for USA).
            createdDate:datetime Auto Note: since internally there are two records internally with this field duplicated, the public value is get from the
                                        [address] table (the first record to be created). 
            updatedDate:datetime Auto Note: since internally there are two records internally with this field duplicated, the public value is get from the
                                        one with the newest/greater value.
            kind:string Computed Note: possible set of server-set values is: home, billing, service. It matches every API path, and all addresses returned
                                    from each path will have the same value for Kind matching that API path. Is just an informative field and cannot be 
                                    specified by the user.
