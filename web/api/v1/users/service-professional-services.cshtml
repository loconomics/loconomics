    Fetchs public service professional pricing per job title.

    TODO Force constraints for active pricing, active service professional profile when fetching this data,
    right now the same service professional API is being used and is not completely secure for public access.

    TODO Double check if an API to access a specific serviceProfessionalServiceID is needed

    TODO Clean-up of fields that are not needed publicly.

    TODO New query param or entry point /service-professional-services/{jobTitleID}/for-me The idea of this is
    about to include special services available only for the currently logged client (*client services*, like multi-session
    packages previously paid, VIP prices, first-time only services). Doubt if include only that services to be aggregated to the
    public list by the API consumer or to include all services (public and special), replacing any public service 
    by a same ID special service (that will happen with multi-session and special prices on VIP services).
    Include clientUserID field to the output, will be zero/null for public services and the logged userID for client services.

    Options:
    
    - GET /{jobTitleID}
        List all active pricings for that active job title
