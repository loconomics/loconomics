    Fetch public service professional service addresses per job title.

    TODO Force constraints for active address, active service professional profile when fetching this data,
    right now the same service professional API is being used and is not completely secure for public access.

    TODO Double check if an API to access a specific addressID is needed

    TODO Privacy double check, discuss and ensure a subsset of public fields, fields available to related users (registered clients)
    and owner only fields (that must not be available here since it has its own API).

    Options:
    
    - GET /{jobTitleID}
        List all active service addresses for that active job title
