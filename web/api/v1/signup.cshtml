    Sign-up a user, getting logged if success and returns the same
    result as the Login method. If the user and password exists
    already and match, it just get logged (exception: if the user
    was a customer as is requesting the 'freelancer' type, will become
    a freelance and get logged).

    TODO Coordinate with login about changes in things like old redirectUrl

        - returnProfile:bool as in Login
        - profileType:string Enumeration: 'service-professional', 'client'
            NOTE: Currently allowed: 'freelancer', 'freelance', 'provider' as aliases,
                any other value or not value will create a 'client' profile.

        - profileType:string Enumeration: 'service-professional', 'client'
            NOTE: Currently allowed: 'freelancer', 'freelance', 'provider' as aliases,
                any other value or not value will create a 'client' profile.

    - POST /facebook:
        - accessToken:string Given by the Facebook API on the browser/app
            Currently, as of implementation, is supported too: signed_request and 'Facebook App cookie'
