    Log-out a user setting removing its authentification cookie.

    TODO Is needed? Cookies must not be used, has no sense in a REST API and out-of-the-domain API consumers.
    TODO Is authentication is changed to a key exchange system, logout may be usefull to invalidated the given key
    requiring the user to login again generating a new connection key (right now, there is a single key that is
    the password encrypted, so there is no logout action to perform there, and a password change effectively invalidate
    every saved auth-key).

        "Logout": {
            "url": "/api/v1/en-US/logout",
            "post": {}
