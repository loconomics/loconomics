        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Loconomics Cooperative has designed this Background Check and License Verification Policy (this &#8220;Policy&#8221;) with
            the goal of helping Clients feel at ease when scheduling Service Professionals, while creating work
            opportunities for Service Professionals that may have been served by our justice system. Loconomics
            intends to facilitate the provision of Services in a manner that is both informed and fair. In most
            cases, Background Checks will be done only at the option of the Service Professional, and Loconomics
            will not perform a Background Check without the consent of the Service Professional. However, for
            providers of &#8220;Sensitive Services,&#8221; defined below, Loconomics does require a Background
            Check. In addition, Loconomics requires License Verification for Service Professionals providing
            &#8220;Licensed Professional Services,&#8221; also defined below. The policy for and use of Background
            Check and License Verification information is detailed in this Policy below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information discovered through the Background Check and License Verification processes will be used solely for the purpose
            of evaluating a Service Professional&#8217;s suitability to provide Sensitive Services, Licensed
            Professional Services, or other Services. It will not be used to discriminate against a Service Professional
            on the basis of race, color, religion/creed, sex/gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression,
            national origin, genetic information, marital/familial status, disability, military, veteran status,
            or any other classification protected by law.

        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>
            The &#8220;Authorized Initiator&#8221; is the person(s) formally designated by Loconomics as authorized to initiate Background
            Checks and License Verifications with Loconomics&#8217; Background Researcher. The Authorized Initiator

            the Background Researcher of the identities of people for whom it wishes to run Background Checks
            and License Verification, making decisions regarding what type of Background Check and License Verification
            is appropriate, interpreting Background Check and License Verification records once provided by the
            Background Researcher and displaying information using the Red/Yellow/Green Tiering system described
            in this Policy, including determining whether a Service Professional is eligible to provide Sensitive
            Services or Licensed Professional Services.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                a) criminal background check;
            </li>
            <li>
                b) license/certification history check;

            <li>
                f) healthcare sanctions check
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The nature and scope of the Background Check will vary on a position-by-position basis and will be determined at Loconomics&#8217;
            sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A &#8220;Background Researcher&#8221; is either
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) a third-party vendor (which, as of October 2017, is HireRight) chosen by Loconomics to conduct Background Checks or License
                Verification, or
            </li>
            <li>
                b) a Loconomics staff member tasked with conducting License Verification.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A &#8220;Service Professional&#8221; is defined as a person who has created a User Account to provide Services through the
            Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Licensed Professional Services&#8221; are defined as services for which a Service Professional&#8217;s state imposes
            licensure, certification, registration, or similar requirements upon the persons who perform these
            services.
        </p>
        <p>
            A &#8220;License Verification&#8221; is defined as carrying out research to verify that a Service Professional has any legally
            required professional license, certification, or registration required in connection with the type
            of Services to be offered by the Service Professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Sensitive Services&#8221; are defined as services offered to and specifically targeting vulnerable persons, such as
            those involving care for children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. The mere offering
            of Services to the general public, including the elderly, children, and persons with disabilities,
            does not make the Services Sensitive Services. Rather, Services specifically targeted at these vulnerable
            populations are Sensitive Services. Loconomics shall have sole discretion to determine which Services
            offered via its Service constitute Sensitive Services.

        <h2>3. Required Background Checks</h2>
        <h3>Sensitive Services.</h3>
        <p>
            Background Checks are required for any Service Professional offering to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) The Background Check shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures outlined in this Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                b) Loconomics shall publicly post the results of the Background Check only in summary form, utilizing the Red/Yellow/Green
                tiering system described below in order to provide Clients information upon which to make informed
                decisions. In no event shall Loconomics post specific information regarding the results of the
                Background Check (e.g., Loconomics shall not post any information about specific offenses committed
                or the particular type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider the Service Professional&#8217;s
                privacy at all times when posting the results of the Background Check.
            </li>
            <li>
                c) Any Service Professional who does not wish to undergo a Background Check may inform Loconomics that the Service Professional
                no longer wishes to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics Service by e-mailing

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedures for Carrying out a Background Check in Connection with the Provision of Sensitive Services.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) Service Professionals will be notified at the time they indicate their intent to provide Sensitive Services that they
                must successfully pass a Background Check prior to offering to provide Sensitive Services via
                the Loconomics Service.
            </li>
            <li>
                b) Background Checks will be conducted in accordance with applicable law. Once a Service Professional indicates their intent
                to provide Sensitive Services, Loconomics or appointed third-party vendor will provide the Service
                Professional an authorization form in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and/or
                California Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) or other similar laws in other
                states, if applicable. If requested, the Service Professional will be provided a copy of this
                Background Check policy. Any Service Professional who refuses to sign and return this authorization
                form consenting to a Background Check, refuses to provide information necessary to conduct the
                Background Check, or provides false or misleading information will not be permitted to offer
                to provide Sensitive Services.
            </li>
            <li>
                c) Upon receiving the Service Professional&#8217;s signed authorization form, the Background Check will be initiated by the
                Authorized Initiator. All Background Checks will be conducted by a third party service provider
                (the &#8220;Vendor&#8221;) at the direction of the Authorized Initiator.
            </li>
            <li>
                d) Upon completion of the Background Check, the Vendor will forward the results to the Authorized Initiator. The Vendor shall
                also inform the Service Professional of the results, provide the Service Professional an opportunity
                to review the report, and inform the Service Professional of their rights under the Fair Credit
                Reporting Act and the California Investigative Consumer Reporting Act, or similar laws in other
                states, if applicable.
            </li>
            <li>
                e) The Authorized Initiator will review the results in accordance with the Red/Yellow/Green Tier guidelines described below,
                provide Pre-Adverse Action Notices and/or Adverse Actions Notices as may be required below, and
                will make the final determination as to the Red/Yellow/Green Tier assigned to the Service Professional
                on the Service Professional&#8217;s profile page. If a Service Professional receives a Red Tier
                rating, the Service Professional may not offer to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics
                Service. The Service Professional may, however, offer to provide non-Sensitive Services via the
                Loconomics Service.
            </li>
            <li>
                f) The Loconomics online Service shall not permit a Service Professional to create a listing offering to provide Sensitive
                Services unless that Service Professional has passed a Background Check with satisfactory results.
                If the Service Professional attempts to create a listing offering to provide Sensitive Services
                without having undergone a Background Check, the Loconomics online Service will not permit the
                Service Professional to create this listing and will instruct the Service Professional as to
                the Background Check requirement. If the Service Professional attempts to add a category of Sensitive
                Services to that Service Professional&#8217;s profile page, the Loconomics online Service will
                block the Service Professional from offering these Sensitive Services via the Loconomics online
                Service.

        <h2>4. Discretionary Background Checks</h2>
        <h3>Service Professionals not Providing Sensitive Services. </h3>
        <p>
            If a Service Professional is not required to undergo a Background Check as described in Section 3, the Service Professional
            may voluntarily choose to complete a Background Check. Background Checks may be required for Service
            Professionals at the discretion of Loconomics for any Service Professional or position not otherwise
            defined herein for any reason and at any time. In the event that a discretionary Background Check
            is carried out, the Service Professional may choose to withdraw as a Service Professional from Loconomics
            if the Service Professional does not wish to undergo or share results of a Background Check. If the
            Service Professional opts to the complete the Background Check, Loconomics shall publicly post the
            results of the Background Check in summary form, utilizing the &#8220;Red/Yellow/Green&#8221; tiering
            system described below in order to provide Clients information upon which to make informed decisions.
            In no event shall Loconomics post specific information regarding the results of the Background Check
            (e.g., Loconomics shall not post any information about specific offenses committed or the particular
            type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider the Service Professional&#8217;s privacy
            at all times when posting the results of the Background Check.

        <h2>7. Red/Yellow/Green Tiering System</h2>
        <p>
            Results from a Background Check or License Verification will be considered in the following manner:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a)
                <strong>Automatic Green Tier.</strong> If the results of the Service Professional&#8217;s Background
                Check show no flagged items or only minor traffic violations, the Service Professional shall
                be ranked in the &#8220;Green Tier.&#8221; If the results of the Service Professional&#8217;s
                License Verification show that all relevant certifications, licenses, and registrations are in
                current and in good standing, the Service Professional shall be ranked in the &#8220;Green Tier.&#8221;
            </li>
            <li>
                b)
                <strong>Presumptive Red Tier.</strong> If the results of the Service Professional&#8217;s Background
                Check show that the Service Professional has been convicted of an offense involving serious violent
                acts, or child or persons with disabilities or elder abuse (excluding statutory rape offenses),
                then the Service Professional shall presumptively be ranked in the &#8220;Red Tier,&#8221; subject
                to the Pre-Adverse Action Procedures described below. The Service Professional shall not be permitted
                to offer to provide Sensitive Services unless the Service Professional demonstrates a compelling
                reason why such a &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; ranking is inappropriate. In the event that the Service
                Professional is assigned a &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; ranking, the Service Professional may offer
                to provide non-Sensitive Services, but Loconomics shall post the &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; notation
                assigned to the Service Professional on the Service Professional&#8217;s profile page (either
                directly or accessible by link).

            <li>
                c)
                <strong>Yellow Tier.</strong> For Service Professionals who, after a Background Check, are not ranked
                as a Presumptive Red Tier or Automatic Green Tier, Loconomics will conduct a case-by-base review
                pursuant to the procedures outlined in section (d) below. After conducting this review, if Loconomics
                believes that the Service Professional&#8217;s suitability to offer Sensitive Services is below-average,
                but that the Service Professional should be permitted to offer these Sensitive Services, then
                Loconomics shall assign the Service Professional a &#8220;Yellow Tier&#8221; ranking in order
                to aid Clients in making informed decisions, subject to the Pre-Adverse Action Procedures described
                below.

            <li>
                d)
                <strong>Case-By-Case Consideration.</strong> For Service Professionals who, after a Background Check,
                are not ranked as a presumptive Red Tier or Automatic Green Tier, determination of the Service
                Professional&#8217;s suitability to offer Sensitive Services will be made on a case-to-case basis
                and in accordance with applicable law. Loconomics&#8217; consideration shall include, but not
                be limited to, the following factors:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>
                        Number of offenses or misconduct and the circumstances of each;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Length of time between the offense or misconduct and the time at which the Background Check is carried out;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Age of Service Professional at the time of the offense;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other employment history;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Evidence of rehabilitation efforts (or lack thereof);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Severity and specific circumstances of the offense or misconduct;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The relevance of the offense or misconduct to responsibilities of the position;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nature of work to be performed;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whether the Service Professional has pending charges; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any other relevant information, including information submitted by the Service Professional or requested by the Authorized
                        Initiator.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once Loconomics has considered the offenses in light of the factors above, Loconomics will determine whether the Service
                    Professional should be assigned the ranking of Red Tier (meaning that the Service Professional
                    is prohibited from offering Sensitive Services), Yellow Tier (meaning that the Service Professional
                    may offer Sensitive Services, but that the Service Professional&#8217;s suitability for offering
                    such services is below average), or Green Tier (meaning that the Service Professional&#8217;s
                    Background Check showed no indication that the Service Professional is unsuitable to offer
                    Sensitive Services).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                e)
                <strong>Arrest Information.</strong> Loconomics will not consider arrest information unless the arrest
                resulted in pending criminal charges. In such circumstances, Loconomics will contact the Service
                Professional, and may contact other parties to obtain further information in order to assess
                reliability of the charge information. Loconomics will consider any information revealed regarding
                convictions, although a Conviction (defined as a guilty verdict, a guilty plea, or a pleas of
                Nolo Contendere of felony or misdemeanor, other than minor traffic offenses) shall not automatically
                preclude the individual from offering Sensitive Services or obtaining a &#8220;Green Tier&#8221;
                ranking.
            </li>
            <li>
                f)
                <strong>Assignment of Tier Ranking, Pre-Adverse Action Notices, and Adverse Action Notices</strong>.
                After the Authorized Initiator has evaluated the results in accordance with the guidelines above,
                the Authorized Initiator shall assign the Service Professional a Red, Yellow, or Green Tier ranking.
                If a &#8220;Yellow Tier&#8221; or &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; ranking is assigned, Loconomics shall
                follow the procedures described below with respect to Pre-Adverse Action Notice and Adverse Action
                Notice. The tier ranking shall be posted or linked to on the Service Professional&#8217;s profile
                page along with an explanation as to the meaning of the ranking. This explanation may entail
                a general overview as to the types of offenses that might justify the ranking, but the explanation
                shall not include detail as to the particular offenses committed by the Service Professional
                or otherwise inappropriately disclose the Service Professional&#8217;s private information.
            </li>
            <li>
                g)
                <strong>Failure to Show Necessary License/Certification/Registration</strong>. If the results of a License
                Verification show that the Service Professional lacks any license, certification, and/or registration
                required in connection with Licensed Professional Services to be offered, then the Service Professional
                shall not be permitted to offer Licensed Professional Services unless the Service Professional
                provides information clearly confirming the existence and good standing of such license, certification,
                and/or registration. In the event that the Service Professional fails to show any required such
                license, certification, and/or registration, the Service Professional may offer to provide Services
                other than Licensed Professional Services.

            <li>
                h)
                <strong>Pre-Adverse Action Notices. </strong>To the extent required by applicable law, Loconomics will
                notify the Service Professional in writing that adverse information was revealed during the Background
                Check or License Verification process that may impact the Service Professional&#8217;s ability
                to offer to provide services. Loconomics will provide a copy of the supporting Background Check
                or License Verification report to the Service Professional along with a copy of &#8220;A Summary
                of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.&#8221; The Service Professional will be given
                no less than five days to challenge the information provided in the report and take steps to
                correct inaccuracies or provide explanation.
                <p>
                    A final adverse decision will not be made until the Service Professional&#8217;s new information has been considered or such
                    time that the Service Professional fails to respond as required.

                notify the Service Professional in writing that adverse information was revealed during the Background
                Check or License Verification process that may impact the Service Professional&#8217;s ability
                to offer to provide services. Loconomics will provide a copy of the supporting Background Check

                <strong>Adverse Action Notice. </strong>If, after considering the Service Professional&#8217;s response,
                Loconomics determines that the negative information revealed results in an adverse decision (e.g.,
                that the Service Professional cannot offer to provide Sensitive Services, or that the Service
                Professional will be assigned a &#8220;Yellow Tier&#8221; or &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; ranking),
                a second written notification will be sent to the Service Professional. This notice shall include
