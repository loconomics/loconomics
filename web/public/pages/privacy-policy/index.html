        <p>
            Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes
            the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) With affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Loconomics) who may only use
                the Personal Information for the purposes described herein.

                b) With third party vendors who provide administrative, professional, financial, and communication services on our behalf,
                such as website hosting, processing and delivery mailings, providing customer support, conducting
                Background Checks, or providing credit card processing services (collectively known as “Service

            <li>
                c) We may share Client Personal Information (other than credit card information) with Service Professionals. We may provide

                Professional through Loconomics, or if you participated in an offer, contest or other activity

                Service Professionals with Personal Information about Clients who have purchased the Service
                Professionals' Services, to send customized offers, to validate the purchases, to aid and troubleshoot
                redemption, to combat fraud, as part of legal proceedings affecting Loconomics and the Service
                Professional, to facilitate a direct relationship between Service Professionals and Clients,
                and to enable Service Professionals to communicate electronically with Clients who purchased
                the Service Professionals' Services.

                that Partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information.

                governance functions. We may also disclose Personal Information in litigation or a regulatory
                action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar
                legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts where we operate.
                If Loconomics is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
                you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership

        <h2>8. Security of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to us. Loconomics has implemented an information security program
            that contains administrative, technical, and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard
            Personal Information. We follow generally accepted standards to facilitate compliance with HIPAA,
            including the following technological safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to
            us, both during transmission and once we receive it:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) patient/client information and other sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) are transferred using 168-bit
                SSL encryption; accounts require secure login with minimum password length enforcement;
            </li>
            <li>
                b) the production environment is protected by stand-alone firewalls with access limited to authorized personnel via encrypted
                channels;
            </li>
            <li>
                c) and offsite backups are made daily and stored in an encrypted state.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Further, Loconomics requires all personnel with access to patient/client information for purposes of providing technical
            support to be trained in the privacy requirements of HIPAA. Loconomics does not share, sell, disclose
            or provide patient/client information to third parties unless required by law and in accordance with
            the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics also provides numerous settings and features—including user-specific login, multiple user access levels, and the
            ability to easily add and remove users—to facilitate procedural standards that enable you to maintain
            overall HIPAA compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with any technology, it's incumbent upon you to properly incorporate Loconomics into your business practices and make
            your own assessment of your resulting overall HIPAA compliance. No method of transmission over the
            Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that such
            information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
            technical, or managerial safeguards.

        <h2>12. Facebook Connect</h2>
        <p>
            Loconomics offers Facebook users the opportunity to interact with friends and to share on Facebook using Facebook Connect.
            If you are logged into both Loconomics and Facebook, when you use the Website's Facebook connection
            functions, we will link your Facebook account with your Loconomics account if the email addresses
            match. If the email addresses do not match, we may ask you if you want to link them and you must
            validate that you control the accounts. If you are already logged into Loconomics but not logged
            into Facebook, when you use the Website's Facebook connection functions, you will be prompted to
            enter your Facebook credentials or to sign up for Facebook. By proceeding through any of these scenarios,
            you grant Loconomics permission to access your Facebook profile information and to use it in accordance
            with the Facebook terms of use and this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are not currently registered as a Loconomics User and you use the Website's Facebook connection functions, you will
            first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join
            Loconomics. Once you register with Loconomics and connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically
            post recent Loconomics activity back to your Facebook wall. Please refer to the privacy settings
            in your Facebook account to manage the performance of your Facebook account.
