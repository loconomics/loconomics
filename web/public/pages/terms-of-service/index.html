        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Loconomics.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Terms of Service (“Agreement”) contain the terms on which Loconomics Cooperative, Inc. (“Loconomics” or “Loconomics
            Cooperative”), a California Consumer Cooperative Corporation, offers you access to
            <a
                href="http://www.loconomics.com/">www.loconomics.com</a>, an internet platform (”Website") and mobile application (“Loconomics Application”).
            Loconomics Cooperative owns and operates this Website, the Loconomics Application, the mobile and
            touch versions of the Website, and any individual websites or service-professional-specific, city-specific,
            or other area-specific websites we have now or in the future. The Loconomics Application, the Website,
            and links contained within or otherwise available through external hyperlinks within or directed
            to our Website or the Loconomics Application, and various services provided by Loconomics or third
            parties will be collectively referred to as the “Loconomics Service.”
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the Loconomics Service, you agree to this Agreement with Loconomics. It is important that you understand the Agreement,
            because the Agreement governs your relationship with Loconomics as well as transactions made with
            third parties using Loconomics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Agreement includes:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                a) Your agreement that the Loconomics Service is provided “as is” and without warranty (Section 21).
            </li>
            <li>
                b) Your agreement that Loconomics has no liability regarding the Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service (Section
                20).
            </li>
            <li>
                c) Your consent to release Loconomics from liability based on claims between Users (Section 17).
            </li>
            <li>
                d) Your agreement to indemnify Loconomics from claims due to your use or inability to use the Loconomics Service or content
                submitted to the Loconomics Service in connection with your account or profile (Section 22).
            </li>
            <li>
                e) Your consent that either party has the right to compel arbitration (Section 18).
            </li>
            <li>
                f) Your consent that no claims can be adjudicated on a class basis (Section 18).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This Agreement is effective on October 1st, 2017 for current users, and upon acceptance for new users.

        <h2>2. Use of the Loconomics Service</h2>
        <p>
            Before you may become a User of the Loconomics Service, you must read and accept all of the terms of this Agreement, the
            Loconomics
            <a href="../../pages/privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy</a>, the Loconomics
            <a href="../../pages/background-check-policy">Background Check and License Verification Policy</a>, and other policies currently published on the
            Website. You agree that this Agreement, the
            <a href="../../pages/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, the
            <a href="../../pages/background-check-policy">Background Check and License Verification Policy</a>, and other published policies on the Website
            will apply whenever you use the Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are responsible for all equipment required to access the Loconomics Service, including but not limited to, a properly-configured
            computer or smartphone with Internet access, any required software such as a properly-configured
            Internet browser or mobile application, and any other equipment needed to use the Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only persons who are 18 years old or older may become a User of the Loconomics Service. This is because persons who are under
            18 years old are unable to enter into binding contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not interfere with the proper working of the Loconomics Service. You may not copy, modify, or distribute (a) content
            from the Loconomics Service or (b) any other content covered by Loconomics' copyrights and trademarks.
            You may not harvest or otherwise collect information about Users, including email addresses, without
            those Users' consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your User Account may be terminated without warning if Loconomics believes that you have violated any term of this Agreement
            or any federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.

    <section id="terms-of-service-neutral-venue">
        <h2>3. Neutral Venue</h2>
        <p>
            The Loconomics Service is a communications and client management platform for connecting people offering Services (“Service
            Professionals”) and people looking for Services (“Clients”). Service Professionals, Website visitors,
            Clients, and other users of the Loconomics Service together are referred to as "Users." The work
            that a Service Professional will provide to a Client, and for which the Client will pay the Service
            Professional, is referred to as “Services.” Services also include any materials provided by the Service
            Professional, either with or without charge, to the Client. Loconomics creates a neutral venue for
            Service Professionals to find Clients, and for Clients to find Service Professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users contract for Services directly with other Users. Loconomics does not take part in the Services provided to Clients
            by Service Professionals and will not be a party to any contracts for Services. Rather, Loconomics
            is merely a communication, scheduling, and payment processing platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the Loconomics Service, you may be a Service Professional, a Client, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether written or oral, implied or express, on behalf
            of Loconomics.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="terms-of-service-no-employment-of-service-professionals">
        <h2>4. No Employment of Service Professionals</h2>
        <p>
            Loconomics is not an employer of the Service Professionals and Service Professionals do not become Loconomics employees by
            providing Services to Clients or by becoming Owners of Loconomics. You acknowledge that we do not
            supervise, direct, control, or make representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness,
            or accuracy of the Services offered and provided by Service Professionals through the Loconomics
            Service in any manner. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee
            relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by the receipt of any benefits or advantages
            received by Service Professionals through Loconomics. As such, we will not be liable for any tax
            or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social
            security, or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Loconomics Service. You understand
            and agree that if we are found to be liable for any tax or tax withholding in connection with your
            use of Services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including
            any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold harmless, reimburse (for
            taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees), and defend us from any and all claims that a Service
            Professional was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee, any claims that we were
            an employer or joint employer of a Service Professional, and any claims under any employment-related
            laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation,
            wage and hour laws, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's
            compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals are solely responsible for all aspects of the Services they perform, including the quality, timing,
            legality, or failure to provide Services. Loconomics does not control the actions or inactions of
            Users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics does not provide any materials or supplies to provide the Services. Service Professionals must provide their own
            tools and equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals manage their own schedules, availability, pricing, and quality of Services provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics does not require training for Service Professionals, apart from training that the Service Professional must obtain
            for providing Licensed Professional Services. However, optional training may be offered as a benefit
            for Loconomics Owners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals are encouraged to advertise independently.
        </p>
        <p>
            One purpose of forming Loconomics as a cooperative is to provide ideal working opportunities and conditions to independent
            Service Professionals, while ensuring that Services Professionals remain independent and have choice
            and flexibility in their work.

        <h2>5. User Accounts and Communication</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a Client, you must create a User Account with Loconomics to schedule an appointment. If you are a Service Professional,
            you must create a User Account with Loconomics to use the Loconomics Service. If you create a User
            Account with us, you agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information and to update such
            data as necessary. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that your information is inaccurate,
            we may suspend or terminate your account and prohibit you from any use of the Loconomics Service
            (see also Section 14, “Loconomics Service Termination”). You agree not to use any user name that
            is obscene, defamatory, or derogatory. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your password and for changing your password if you believe that it has been stolen or might otherwise
            be misused. You agree to notify Loconomics immediately of any unauthorized use of your user name
            and/or password and any other suspected breach of security regarding the Loconomics Service. We shall
            not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized use of your user name and/or password.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any personally identifiable information supplied will be subject to the terms of the
            <a href="../../pages/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By providing your phone number and using the Loconomics Service, you hereby affirmatively consent to Loconomics and Users
            conducting transactions with each other through the Loconomics Service using your phone number for
            calls and, if such phone number is a mobile number, for text messages, in order to assist with facilitating
            the requested Services. Standard call or message charges or other charges from your phone carrier
            may apply to calls or text messages we send you. You may opt-out of receiving text messages from
            Loconomics by replying with the word "STOP" to a text message from Loconomics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics may send you confirmation and other transactional emails regarding the Services. Loconomics may also send you
            emails about services that we think might interest you (“Promotional Emails”). The Promotional Emails
            include an option for you to opt out of receiving such emails.

    <section id="terms-of-service-section">
        <h2>6. Rules for Service Professionals</h2>
        <p>
            Service Professionals must be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies; however, worker-owned cooperatives
            and nonprofit organizations may be Service Professionals if approved as Owners according to the Bylaws
            and any other policies specifically applicable to worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations.
            Except in the case of worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations, the profile you create
            must represent a single person performing Services; you may not have employees, agents, or substitutes
            provide Services on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals may choose to partner with other Service Professionals using our group scheduling functionality to
            perform particular Services that require more than one person. In such cases, Service Professionals
            must still be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals must perform Services at the scheduled time and as described to the Client when scheduling or, if you
            are unable to fulfill Services at the scheduled time, you must promptly notify the Client and cancel
            or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals are responsible for managing availability for online appointments including maintaining the accuracy
            and completeness of available times, Services available, service locations and/or service areas,
            and all other information necessary for Clients to schedule online appointments with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals offering mental and health care Services that are reimbursable by federal and state health care programs
            agree:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) not to seek reimbursement from any third party payer (including, but not limited to, Medicare or Medi-Cal) for any portion,
                in whole or in part, of the Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, and to accept
                as payment in full the amount paid by Client for the Services at the time of scheduling (or later,
                if so agreed);
            </li>
            <li>
                b) not to offer Services at discounted or promotional pricing through the Loconomics Service, and not to advertise any such
                discounts or promotions through the Loconomics Service.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Services cannot, under any circumstances, include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) sexual activity; or
            </li>
            <li>
                b) unlawful activity of any kind.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally able to provide your Services.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You represent that you have the legal ability in your jurisdiction and where you are marketing your Services to perform the
            Services listed in the Loconomics Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent that you
            have any license required to provide your Services and are willing to undergo a Background Check
            prior to providing Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services (see also Section 19, “Background Checks”).

    </section>
    <section id="terms-of-service-rules-for-clients">
        <h2>7. Rules for Clients</h2>
        <p>
            Clients are solely responsible for choosing suitable Service Professionals. Loconomics does not endorse any Service Professional.
            When acting as a Client, you agree that Loconomics is not responsible or liable for unsatisfactory
            Services performed by Service Professionals. You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary
            or appropriate before hiring or engaging a Service Professional (see also Section 19, “Background
            Checks”).
        </p>
        <p>
            Clients are responsible for attending (if so agreed at the time of scheduling) all appointments made through the Loconomics
            Service or, if you are unable to attend an appointment, to promptly notify the Service Professional
            and cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not hire Service Professionals with the purpose of reselling their Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will take the necessary safety precautions when meeting Service Professionals to ensure both their and your own safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            You accept responsibility to confirm that the Service Professional's identity and professional license or certification (if
            required) match the information on their profile.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="terms-of-service-fee-structure">
        <h2>8. Fee Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Joining Loconomics, viewing profiles, and viewing descriptions of Services are free. Current fees for all services are listed
            on our
            <a href="../../pages/fees">Fees page</a>. The following provides a general overview of fee structure and which specific fee
            amounts are subject to change.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a Service Professional, you may use the Loconomics Service free of charge for a limited time per any promotional
            terms (“Trial Period”). After the Trial Period has ended, payment of a monthly or annual fee “User
            Fee” is required to continue using the Loconomics Service. A valid credit card is required, and the
            User Fee is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis (“Billing Period”) in accordance with
            our pricing schedule. Payment for the first Billing Period of service will become due immediately
            upon the end of the Trial Period; if you have not yet entered your credit card information, we will
            prompt you for this information. You must enter your credit card information before the end of the
            Trial Period or your account will become inaccessible. After your credit card information is entered,
            your credit card will be immediately charged for the first Billing Period of service. Thereafter,
            your credit card will be billed for each Billing Period after the Trial Period until your account
            is terminated by you or by Loconomics. You warrant that the credit card you enter is good and valid,
            and that you are authorized to use such credit card. You authorize Loconomics to charge such credit
            card for amounts due for the Loconomics Service. Loconomics reserves the right to suspend or cancel
            your account if a charge to your credit card is denied or disputed. All payments are non-refundable;
            Loconomics does not refund for partial months of service or non-use of the Loconomics Service. All
            fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities with respect to
            your use of the Loconomics Service, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies,
            or duties.
        </p>

            Loconomics may charge a fee to Clients upon scheduling of Services through the Loconomics Service. Any “Booking Fee” will
            be disclosed at the time the scheduling is made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics intentionally does not charge any Booking Fee for any mental or health care Services regulated under federal or
            state law prohibiting such fees. Should you feel a Booking Fee has been charged in error for such
            Services, please e-mail
            <a href="mailto:support@loconomics.com?subject=Booking%20Fee%20Error">support@loconomics.com</a> and it will be refunded and corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics charges a set fee for certain premium services, such as a Background Check. The cost of a premium service is disclosed
            at the time you sign up for the premium service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics deducts the Payment Service Provider's payment processing fees from the total amount paid by a Client for Services
            before transferring the Payment Amount owed to a Service Professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics reserves the right to change the fee structure set forth above, at its sole discretion. Loconomics will give Users
            at least fourteen (14) calendar days' notice of any change to the fee structure by posting the change
            on the Loconomics Service.

        <h2>9. Payments, Adjustments, and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            Users of the Loconomics Service may be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Loconomics and the
            Payment Service Provider “PSP” retained by Loconomics (currently, Braintree, a division of PayPal,
            Inc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            The cost of Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, any agreed out of pocket expenses owed to the Service Professional,
            any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and any service fees owed to Loconomics for the use of the Loconomics
            Service are collectively referred to as the “Payment Amount.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When payment is required when scheduling Services, Loconomics will charge the Client's credit card the Payment Amount after
            the appointment for the scheduled Services. Loconomics may also put a hold on the Client's credit
            card for the Payment Amount at the time the appointment is scheduled through the Loconomics Service
            to ensure that payment can be taken at the appropriate time. Certain Services may require that, by
            a clearly stated deadline, a Client and/or Service Professional mark that Services are complete after
            the appointment is finished and/or finalize a Payment Amount. Should the User not complete the requested
            actions before the deadline, the User forfeits their right to make any adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
            When payment is not required at the time of scheduling an appointment, the Client agrees to pay the Service Professional
            the Payment Amount using the Service Professional's preferred payment option(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals may make bundles or packages available in which Users can purchase multiple Services or sessions in
            a single transaction. All sessions of the Services must be scheduled through the Loconomics Service.
            Service Professionals may set an expiration date for any bundle or package, and any unused package
            value is lost as of the expiration date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clients may have the option of choosing that the Services to be repeated on a regular basis (“Recurrent Services”). For example,
            a Client may choose that Services be performed every two weeks. When a Client chooses Recurrent Services,
            Loconomics will automatically schedule those Recurrent Services to occur on future dates indefinitely
            at the frequency requested by the Client. The Client's credit card will be charged for the Recurrent
            Services as the appointments for Services occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Loconomics
            cannot guarantee appointments for Recurrent Services will not be canceled or rescheduled by the Service
            Professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Services may be canceled or rescheduled up to the "Cancellation Period" (the advance notice prior to the scheduled appointment
            time required to effect an appointment cancellation outlined in the Service Professional's own policy
            on cancellation (“Cancellation Policy”) of the appointment to take place. If you wish to cancel or
            reschedule Services, you must do so by using the appointment cancellation feature through the Loconomics
            Service prior to any Cancellation Period for such Services. You understand and agree that should
            you cancel or reschedule your Services after the Cancellation Period or if you do not show up for
            your appointment time, you may be charged part of or the full value of the Services in accordance
            with the Service Professional's Cancellation Policy (“Cancellation Fee”).
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals set their own Cancellation Policies, and Loconomics must enforce these Cancellation Policies. It is
            therefore very important to understand a Service Professional's Cancellation Policy prior to attempting
            to cancel or reschedule an appointment. A full refund of a Cancellation Fee may be issued to a Client
            upon three events:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) if the Client cancels Services before the Cancellation Period;
            </li>
            <li>
                b) if the Service Professional cancels the Client Services; or
            </li>
            <li>
                c) if the Service Professional refuses to honor any Services at the agreed date and time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you wish to make a request for a refund, any such request for refund must be made within 48 hours after the scheduled
            end time of the Services. For each valid refund request, Loconomics will refund the Payment Amount
            upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the User Account of the Client with
            an equivalent value in Loconomics "Credits" for future purchases through the Loconomics Service.
            Loconomics Credits do not expire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (a) place on hold all or a portion of
            any Payment Amount, or (b) refund the Payment Amount, provide Credits, or arrange for the PSP to
            provide a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Professionals may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP, and go through a vetting
            process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between
            Service Professionals and the PSP retained by Loconomics are available by clicking
            <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/payment-services-agreement">here</a> (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Service, each Service Professional agrees
            that they have opened, downloaded, or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please
            note that Loconomics is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP, and any other parties
            listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that Loconomics has no obligations
            or liability to any Service Professional under the PSP Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users of the Loconomics Service will be liable for any taxes required to be paid on the Services provided under the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because state and local tax laws vary significantly by locality, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible
            for determining your own tax reporting requirements in consultation with tax advisors, and that Loconomics
            cannot and does not offer tax advice to Service Professionals or Clients. You have to pay your taxes
            for any income you receive in transactions resulting from using Loconomics. We are not liable for
            your nonpayment of taxes.

        <h2>18. Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
            We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with Loconomics. If those efforts fail, by
            using the Loconomics Service you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against
            Loconomics arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, the Loconomics
            Service, or the purchase or sale of any Services, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding
            arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single
            arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures").
            You agree further that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by
                you and Loconomics;
            </li>
            <li>
                b) The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations,
                and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
            </li>
            <li>
                c) There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide
                only your and/or Loconomics' individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join
                the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
            </li>
            <li>
                d) In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs
                of litigation, Loconomics will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with
                the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive;
                and
            </li>
            <li>
                e) With the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable,
                or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the
                balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
                with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained
                herein. If, however, subpart (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the
                entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Loconomics
