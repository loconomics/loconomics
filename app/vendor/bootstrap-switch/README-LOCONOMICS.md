# Bootstrap Switch Custom Build

The files under /css and /js are from the /dist folder of the original project.
The /less-bootstrap3 is a mix of:
- original files:
  - bootstrap-switch.less
  - build.less
- Loconomics custom Bootstrap build:
  - mixims.less
  - /mixims folder
- Loconomics generated files based on custom Bootstrap build and config
  - variables.less (generated from the config.json, see /vendor/bootstrap)
  
The Loconomics custom Bootstrap files comes from the styleguide/vendor files (copied).
  
The folder /custom-css contains the file generated by the build process.

## Build  

Compiling the file /less-bootstrap3/build.less with the Less preprocessor, like:
> lessc ./less-bootstrap3/build.less > ./custom-css/bootstrap-switch.css

That's way we have a custom Loconomics build for the Bootstrap Switch styles,
for example to get the plugin in our colors palette.
