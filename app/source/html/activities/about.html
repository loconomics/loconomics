                    <p>Loconomics Cooperative is an app for booking local services owned by local service professionals.</p>
                    <p>Loconomics is structured as a freelancer and employee-owned cooperative, with no middle-men or millionaires in sight. Loconomics is part of a growing movement called <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/what-is-platform-cooperativism-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank" class="text-secondary">"Platform Cooperativism"</a></p>
                    <p>We've spent the last several years using and observing various sharing economy and on-demand platforms. They've change how we do business, how we're employed, and how we consume. We wanted Loconomics to use this revolutionary technology to create a marketplace that not only provides tools and technology, but that puts service professionals first, gives them ownership, and helps them become better businesspeople.</p>
                    <p><strong>Loconomics is about consuming local services that change people, make lives better, and keeps money circulating locally.</strong></p>
                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Loconomics Cooperative’s mission is to use technology, shared ownership, and community to strengthen local economies.</p>
                    <p>We provide tools, a marketplace, and community to our owners, empowering them to thrive in their work as local service professionals.</p>
                    <p>We provide their clients an app where they can discover and directly book local service professionals safely and easily, without middle-men.</p>
                    <h2>Cooperative Model</h2>
                    <p>Loconomics chose to form as a cooperative in order to steward its tools, platform, services, resources, community, and opportunities as a commons. As writer David Bollier describes, “A commons may arise whenever a group of people decides that it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard for equitable access [...] and long-term stewardship.” </p>
                    <p>Loconomics is substantially shielded from the lust for wealth accumulation and short-term gain, thereby allowing it to focus on activities that grow and spread benefit among the owners and communities.</p>
                    <p>A cooperative structure generally demands that every owner have an equal vote in the election of the board and in other major decisions. A cooperative structure also generally demands that the profits of the enterprise be returned to the owners in proportion to each owners’ participation in generating value for the company.</p>
                    <p>Loconomics believes that its mission will be most effectively advanced by this combination of factors, which distinguish a cooperative from conventional for-profit and non-profit organizations.</p>

                        <p>Tired of climbing a ladder to nowhere? Loconomics is taking a different approach to work. Staff trusteeship is a model of organizational governance that views all staff members of the cooperative as trustees of its mission. Staff trusteeship may emerge as a best practice in the governance of cooperatives with a large and geographically dispersed membership base. While the cooperative exists to benefit its members, it may the full-time staff of the cooperative – not the Board of Directors – that is most capable and available to be directly accountable to the large membership base.</p>    
                        <p>In comparison to staff of conventional businesses and organizations, all staff in a staff trusteeship cooperative have heightened responsibility, and, as such, heightened influence within the cooperative. In order to carry out their heightened responsibilities, each staff member will have relatively equal powers to that of other staff members. Each staff member will have opportunities to influence the activities of the cooperative and to influence their realm of work within the cooperative. The Staff Trustees shall use an internal governance/operational model, such as holacracy, that distributes power among them, ensuring a great deal of agency for each staff member.</p>
