                    <p>Loconomics is a cooperative of service professionals (massage therapists, dog walkers, florists, you name it) who want to find clients, help clients find them, and support local business—without middlemen or far-off investors.</p>
                    <p>We're not millionaires. We're no big tech company. We're a cooperative, meaning the better one of our owners does, the better all of us do. If you're an independent professional, it's likely that the sharing economy and booking websites have changed the way you do business. Maybe you're kneading backs, maybe you're wrangling dogs, maybe you're painting houses, maybe you're sitting children. Maybe you do all these things and more. Whatever your specialty, we've created a network and booking platform that puts you first. Rethink the way you're told to run your business: a co-operative model benefits you and the local community.</p>
                    <p><strong>Loconomics is dedicated to our members, who provide helpful, creative, and meaningful services to the Bay Area and beyond.</strong></p>

                        <h2>Mission</h2>
                        <p>Loconomics Cooperative's mission is to use technology, shared ownership, and community to strengthen local economies.</p>
                        <p>We provide tools, a marketplace, and community to our owners, empowering them to thrive in their work as local service professionals.</p>
                        <p>We provide their clients an app where they can discover and directly book local service professionals safely and easily, without middle-men.</p>

                    <section id="about-coop-model">
                        <h2>Cooperative Model</h2>
                        <p>From early on, we knew we wanted to be a cooperative, so that we could pool together our backgrounds, resources, and community into a kind of commons—a public utility that our owners could use. David Bollier, a writer we admire for his commitment to the idea of the commons and an “ethical economy,” writes that a commons arises “whenever a group of people decides that it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard for equitable access…and long-term stewardship.” This is what we're aiming for: a (virtual) place created by and working for our owners.</p>
                        <p>A cooperative structure means that every owner has an equal vote in the election of the Loconomics board and in other major decisions. It also means that the profits generated by Loconomics will be returned to the owners, in proportion to their participation in generating profits. There is also a small team of people working behind-the-scenes on the app and the generalities of Loconomics who, by way of a small monthly fee assessed to owners, will receive capped salaries in order to keep everything running. Pretty simple stuff! And a far cry, we think, from massive corporate booking sites who have no real interest in creating a vital community of member-owners.</p>

                            <p>Josh has an extensive background in business and has hopped between pricing and revenue management, analytics, product strategy and management, contract negotiations, and more. He has two business degrees, if you can believe it, the first (a Bachelor's) from the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management, the second (an MBA) from IESE Business School in Barcelona. Josh is nearly as tall as Twin Peaks, the neighborhood he calls home, and prides himself on being able to change most lightbulbs without “any sort of ladder.” He is currently learning to surf and heads down to Santa Cruz to practice. Josh deeply admires the historian Howard Zinn, who wanted to be remembered “for getting more people to realize that the power which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it.” </p>

He has brought Loconomics to life helping build the original desktop version and creating the mobile app from scratch.

                            <span class="title">Board Member</span>
                            <p>Janelle is a lawyer, advocate, writer, and cartoonist with an extensive background in all things sustainable. The Executive Director (and Co-founder) of the Sustainable Economies Law Center, she has focused on sharing economy law since 2008 at SELC and in her own private practice. Of course, she's also published a book [link] to help people learn about building cooperatives and local sustainable economies. Janelle lives in the Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood and loves visiting Lake Merritt. Her talents beyond law, it seems, are multiple and wildly varied, and include impersonating Elvis and “telling squirrels apart from other squirrels.” Her hero, the 19th century economic justice activist Jane Addams, delivered a quote that Janelle lives for: “The good we secure for ourselves is precarious and uncertain until it is secured for all of us and incorporated into our common life."</p>

                            <p>Christopher has been practicing Reiki since 2010 and is the owner of SF Reiki Center. He also happens to have a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Social Work, and has worked in the social work world for over a decade. He lives in the Tender Nob—what some might call Lower Nob Hill—and loves going to Presidio National Park. Christopher prides himself on listening and being present with everyone, not just his clients. He also volunteers with Shanti's Breast Cancer Program and administers Reiki to breast cancer survivors. When asked about his hero, he cites Maya Angelou: “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."</p>

                            <p>YaVette owns her own massage practice in Berkeley, One Presence Massage. She is also the founder of two organizations—Cowrie Village and BAOBOB, the Bay Area Organization of Black Owned Businesses—both of which challenge mainstream attitudes toward money and focus on building community wealth through alternative economies. She lives in a neighborhood she lovingly calls SoNo, a borderland between South Berkeley and North Oakland. Hard-pressed to choose just one favorite Bay spot, YaVette loves the fire trail hike behind the Claremont, the frontage road waterfront between Emeryville and Gilman, and, of course, Tilden Park. In case you couldn't tell, YaVette is “literally recharged by sunshine.” Her hero? Fanny Lou Hamer, the civil rights and voting rights activist in the Jim Crow South who succinctly summed it up this way: “I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired!”</p>

Before that, she spent about a decade working for non-profit social justice organizations and political campaigns. Amy has an MPA in Sustainable Management from Presidio Graduate School here in San Francisco. She lives in Oakland's Lake Merritt neighborhood and loves to frequent the Albany Bulb with her puppy. One thing that came in handy while community organizing: Amy's exceptional ability to instantly remember people's names. She lives and breathes her hero Buckminster Fuller's words: “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”</p>

                        <h2>Staff trusteeship</h2>
                        <p>Tired of climbing a ladder to nowhere? Loconomics is taking a different approach to work. Staff trusteeship is a model of organizational governance that views all staff members of the cooperative as trustees of its mission. Staff trusteeship may emerge as a best practice in the governance of cooperatives with a large and geographically dispersed membership base. While the cooperative exists to benefit its members, it may the full-time staff of the cooperative – not the Board of Directors – that is most capable and available to be directly accountable to the large membership base.</p>
                        <p>In comparison to staff of conventional businesses and organizations, all staff in a staff trusteeship cooperative have heightened responsibility, and, as such, heightened influence within the cooperative. In order to carry out their heightened responsibilities, each staff member will have relatively equal powers to that of other staff members. Each staff member will have opportunities to influence the activities of the cooperative and to influence their realm of work within the cooperative. The Staff Trustees shall use an internal governance/operational model, such as holacracy, that distributes power among them, ensuring a great deal of agency for each staff member.</p>
