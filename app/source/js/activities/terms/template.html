                        Only persons who are 18 years old or older may become a User of the Loconomics Service. This is because persons who are under

                    <p>
                        The Loconomics Service is a communications and client management platform for connecting people offering Services (“Service
                        Professionals”) and people looking for Services (“Clients”). Service Professionals, Website visitors,
                        Clients, and other users of the Loconomics Service together are referred to as "Users." The work
                        that a Service Professional will provide to a Client, and for which the Client will pay the Service
                        Professional, is referred to as “Services.” Services also include any materials provided by the Service
                        Professional, either with or without charge, to the Client. Loconomics creates a neutral venue for
                        Service Professionals to find Clients, and for Clients to find Service Professionals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users contract for Services directly with other Users. Loconomics does not take part in the Services provided to Clients
                        by Service Professionals and will not be a party to any contracts for Services. Rather, Loconomics
                        is merely a communication, scheduling, and payment processing platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using the Loconomics Service, you may be a Service Professional, a Client, or both.

                    <p>
                        Users do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether written or oral, implied or express, on behalf
                        of Loconomics.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics is not an employer of the Service Professionals and Service Professionals do not become Loconomics employees by
                        providing Services to Clients or by becoming Owners of Loconomics. You acknowledge that we do not
                        supervise, direct, control, or make representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness,
                        or accuracy of the Services offered and provided by Service Professionals through the Loconomics
                        Service in any manner. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee
                        relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by the receipt of any benefits or advantages
                        received by Service Professionals through Loconomics. As such, we will not be liable for any tax
                        or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social
                        security, or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Loconomics Service. You understand
                        and agree that if we are found to be liable for any tax or tax withholding in connection with your
                        use of Services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including
                        any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold harmless, reimburse (for
                        taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees), and defend us from any and all claims that a Service
                        Professional was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee, any claims that we were
                        an employer or joint employer of a Service Professional, and any claims under any employment-related
                        laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation,
                        wage and hour laws, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's
                        compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.

                    <p>
                        Service Professionals are solely responsible for all aspects of the Services they perform, including the quality, timing,
                        legality, or failure to provide Services. Loconomics does not control the actions or inactions of
                        Users.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics does not provide any materials or supplies to provide the Services. Service Professionals must provide their own
                        tools and equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals manage their own schedules, availability, pricing, and quality of Services provided.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics does not require training for Service Professionals, apart from training that the Service Professional must obtain
                        for providing Licensed Professional Services. However, optional training may be offered as a benefit
                        for Loconomics Owners.

                    <p>
                        One purpose of forming Loconomics as a cooperative is to provide ideal working opportunities and conditions to independent
                        Service Professionals, while ensuring that Services Professionals remain independent and have choice
                        and flexibility in their work.

                    <h2>6. Rules for Service Professionals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals must be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies; however, worker-owned cooperatives
                        and nonprofit organizations may be Service Professionals if approved as Owners according to the Bylaws
                        and any other policies specifically applicable to worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations.
                        Except in the case of worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations, the profile you create
                        must represent a single person performing Services; you may not have employees, agents, or substitutes
                        provide Services on your behalf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals may choose to partner with other Service Professionals using our group scheduling functionality to
                        perform particular Services that require more than one person. In such cases, Service Professionals
                        must still be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals must perform Services at the scheduled time and as described to the Client when scheduling or, if you
                        are unable to fulfill Services at the scheduled time, you must promptly notify the Client and cancel
                        or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals are responsible for managing availability for online appointments including maintaining the accuracy
                        and completeness of available times, Services available, service locations and/or service areas,
                        and all other information necessary for Clients to schedule online appointments with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals offering mental and health care Services that are reimbursable by federal and state health care programs
                        agree:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) not to seek reimbursement from any third party payer (including, but not limited to, Medicare or Medi-Cal) for any portion,
                            in whole or in part, of the Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, and to accept
                            as payment in full the amount paid by Client for the Services at the time of scheduling (or later,
                            if so agreed);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) not to offer Services at discounted or promotional pricing through the Loconomics Service, and not to advertise any such
                            discounts or promotions through the Loconomics Service.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        You represent that you have the legal ability in your jurisdiction and where you are marketing your Services to perform the
                        Services listed in the Loconomics Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent that you
                        have any license required to provide your Services and are willing to undergo a Background Check
                        prior to providing Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services (see also Section 19, “Background Checks”).

                    <h2>7. Rules for Clients</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clients are solely responsible for choosing suitable Service Professionals. Loconomics does not endorse any Service Professional.
                        When acting as a Client, you agree that Loconomics is not responsible or liable for unsatisfactory
                        Services performed by Service Professionals. You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary
                        or appropriate before hiring or engaging a Service Professional (see also Section 19, “Background
                        Checks”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clients are responsible for attending (if so agreed at the time of scheduling) all appointments made through the Loconomics
                        Service or, if you are unable to attend an appointment, to promptly notify the Service Professional
                        and cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may not hire Service Professionals with the purpose of reselling their Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will take the necessary safety precautions when meeting Service Professionals to ensure both their and your own safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You accept responsibility to confirm that the Service Professional's identity and professional license or certification (if
                        required) match the information on their profile.

                    <p>
                        Joining Loconomics, viewing profiles, and viewing descriptions of Services are free. Current fees for all services are listed
                        on our
                        <a href="terms/fees">Fees page</a>. The following provides a general overview of fee structure and which specific fee
                        amounts are subject to change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are a Service Professional, you may use the Loconomics Service free of charge for a limited time per any promotional
                        terms (“Trial Period”). After the Trial Period has ended, payment of a monthly or annual fee “User
                        Fee” is required to continue using the Loconomics Service. A valid credit card is required, and the
                        User Fee is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis (“Billing Period”) in accordance with
                        our pricing schedule. Payment for the first Billing Period of service will become due immediately
                        upon the end of the Trial Period; if you have not yet entered your credit card information, we will
                        prompt you for this information. You must enter your credit card information before the end of the
                        Trial Period or your account will become inaccessible. After your credit card information is entered,
                        your credit card will be immediately charged for the first Billing Period of service. Thereafter,
                        your credit card will be billed for each Billing Period after the Trial Period until your account
                        is terminated by you or by Loconomics. You warrant that the credit card you enter is good and valid,
                        and that you are authorized to use such credit card. You authorize Loconomics to charge such credit
                        card for amounts due for the Loconomics Service. Loconomics reserves the right to suspend or cancel
                        your account if a charge to your credit card is denied or disputed. All payments are non-refundable;
                        Loconomics does not refund for partial months of service or non-use of the Loconomics Service. All
                        fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities with respect to
                        your use of the Loconomics Service, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies,
                        or duties.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics may charge a fee to Clients upon scheduling of Services through the Loconomics Service. Any “Booking Fee” will
                        be disclosed at the time the scheduling is made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loconomics intentionally does not charge any Booking Fee for any mental or health care Services regulated under federal or
                        state law prohibiting such fees. Should you feel a Booking Fee has been charged in error for such
                        Services, please e-mail
                        <a href="mailto:support@@loconomics.com?subject=Booking%20Fee%20Error">support@@loconomics.com</a> and it will be refunded and corrected.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics charges a set fee for certain premium services, such as a Background Check. The cost of a premium service is disclosed
                        at the time you sign up for the premium service.

                        Loconomics deducts the Payment Service Provider's payment processing fees from the total amount paid by a Client for Services
                        before transferring the Payment Amount owed to a Service Professional.

                        Loconomics reserves the right to change the fee structure set forth above, at its sole discretion. Loconomics will give Users
                        at least fourteen (14) calendar days' notice of any change to the fee structure by posting the change
                        on the Loconomics Service.

                    <p>
                        Users of the Loconomics Service may be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Loconomics and the
                        Payment Service Provider “PSP” retained by Loconomics (currently, Braintree, a division of PayPal,
                        Inc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cost of Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, any agreed out of pocket expenses owed to the Service Professional,
                        any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and any service fees owed to Loconomics for the use of the Loconomics
                        Service are collectively referred to as the “Payment Amount.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When payment is required when scheduling Services, Loconomics will charge the Client's credit card the Payment Amount after
                        the appointment for the scheduled Services. Loconomics may also put a hold on the Client's credit
                        card for the Payment Amount at the time the appointment is scheduled through the Loconomics Service
                        to ensure that payment can be taken at the appropriate time. Certain Services may require that, by
                        a clearly stated deadline, a Client and/or Service Professional mark that Services are complete after
                        the appointment is finished and/or finalize a Payment Amount. Should the User not complete the requested
                        actions before the deadline, the User forfeits their right to make any adjustments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When payment is not required at the time of scheduling an appointment, the Client agrees to pay the Service Professional
                        the Payment Amount using the Service Professional's preferred payment option(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals may make bundles or packages available in which Users can purchase multiple Services or sessions in
                        a single transaction. All sessions of the Services must be scheduled through the Loconomics Service.
                        Service Professionals may set an expiration date for any bundle or package, and any unused package
                        value is lost as of the expiration date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clients may have the option of choosing that the Services to be repeated on a regular basis (“Recurrent Services”). For example,
                        a Client may choose that Services be performed every two weeks. When a Client chooses Recurrent Services,
                        Loconomics will automatically schedule those Recurrent Services to occur on future dates indefinitely
                        at the frequency requested by the Client. The Client's credit card will be charged for the Recurrent
                        Services as the appointments for Services occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Loconomics
                        cannot guarantee appointments for Recurrent Services will not be canceled or rescheduled by the Service
                        Professional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Services may be canceled or rescheduled up to the "Cancellation Period" (the advance notice prior to the scheduled appointment
                        time required to effect an appointment cancellation outlined in the Service Professional's own policy
                        on cancellation (“Cancellation Policy”) of the appointment to take place. If you wish to cancel or
                        reschedule Services, you must do so by using the appointment cancellation feature through the Loconomics
                        Service prior to any Cancellation Period for such Services. You understand and agree that should
                        you cancel or reschedule your Services after the Cancellation Period or if you do not show up for
                        your appointment time, you may be charged part of or the full value of the Services in accordance
                        with the Service Professional's Cancellation Policy (“Cancellation Fee”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals set their own Cancellation Policies, and Loconomics must enforce these Cancellation Policies. It is
                        therefore very important to understand a Service Professional's Cancellation Policy prior to attempting
                        to cancel or reschedule an appointment. A full refund of a Cancellation Fee may be issued to a Client
                        upon three events:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) if the Client cancels Services before the Cancellation Period;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) if the Service Professional cancels the Client Services; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            c) if the Service Professional refuses to honor any Services at the agreed date and time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to make a request for a refund, any such request for refund must be made within 48 hours after the scheduled
                        end time of the Services. For each valid refund request, Loconomics will refund the Payment Amount
                        upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the User Account of the Client with
                        an equivalent value in Loconomics "Credits" for future purchases through the Loconomics Service.
                        Loconomics Credits do not expire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loconomics reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (a) place on hold all or a portion of
                        any Payment Amount, or (b) refund the Payment Amount, provide Credits, or arrange for the PSP to
                        provide a refund.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP, and go through a vetting
                        process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between
                        Service Professionals and the PSP retained by Loconomics are available by clicking
                        <a
                            href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/payment-services-agreement">here</a> (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Service, each Service Professional agrees
                        that they have opened, downloaded, or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please
                        note that Loconomics is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP, and any other parties
                        listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that Loconomics has no obligations

                        We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with Loconomics. If those efforts fail, by
                        using the Loconomics Service you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against
                        Loconomics arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, the Loconomics
                        Service, or the purchase or sale of any Services, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding
                        arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single
                        arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures").
                        You agree further that:

                        <li>
                            a) The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by
                            you and Loconomics;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations,
                            and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
                        </li>

                            c) There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide
                            only your and/or Loconomics' individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join
                            the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            d) In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs
                            of litigation, Loconomics will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with
                            the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive;

                            e) With the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable,
                            or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the
                            balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
                            with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained
                            herein. If, however, subpart (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the

                            shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

                    <p>
                        The security of your personal information is important to us. Loconomics has implemented an information security program
                        that contains administrative, technical, and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard
                        Personal Information. We follow generally accepted standards to facilitate compliance with HIPAA,
                        including the following technological safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to
                        us, both during transmission and once we receive it:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) patient/client information and other sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) are transferred using 168-bit
                            SSL encryption; accounts require secure login with minimum password length enforcement;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) the production environment is protected by stand-alone firewalls with access limited to authorized personnel via encrypted
                            channels;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            c) and offsite backups are made daily and stored in an encrypted state.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Further, Loconomics requires all personnel with access to patient/client information for purposes of providing technical
                        support to be trained in the privacy requirements of HIPAA. Loconomics does not share, sell, disclose
                        or provide patient/client information to third parties unless required by law and in accordance with
                        the terms of this Privacy Policy.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics also provides numerous settings and features—including user-specific login, multiple user access levels, and the
                        ability to easily add and remove users—to facilitate procedural standards that enable you to maintain
                        overall HIPAA compliance.

                    <p>
                        As with any technology, it's incumbent upon you to properly incorporate Loconomics into your business practices and make
                        your own assessment of your resulting overall HIPAA compliance. No method of transmission over the
                        Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that such
                        information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
                        technical, or managerial safeguards.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics Cooperative has designed this Background Check and License Verification Policy (this &#8220;Policy&#8221;) with
                        the goal of helping Clients feel at ease when scheduling Service Professionals, while creating work
                        opportunities for Service Professionals that may have been served by our justice system. Loconomics
                        intends to facilitate the provision of Services in a manner that is both informed and fair. In most
                        cases, Background Checks will be done only at the option of the Service Professional, and Loconomics
                        will not perform a Background Check without the consent of the Service Professional. However, for
                        providers of &#8220;Sensitive Services,&#8221; defined below, Loconomics does require a Background
                        Check. In addition, Loconomics requires License Verification for Service Professionals providing
                        &#8220;Licensed Professional Services,&#8221; also defined below. The policy for and use of Background
                        Check and License Verification information is detailed in this Policy below.

                    <p>
                        Information discovered through the Background Check and License Verification processes will be used solely for the purpose
                        of evaluating a Service Professional&#8217;s suitability to provide Sensitive Services, Licensed
                        Professional Services, or other Services. It will not be used to discriminate against a Service Professional
                        on the basis of race, color, religion/creed, sex/gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression,
                        national origin, genetic information, marital/familial status, disability, military, veteran status,
                        or any other classification protected by law.

                        oversees the Background Check process, by managing Loconomics&#8217; Background Researcher, informing
                        the Background Researcher of the identities of people for whom it wishes to run Background Checks
                        and License Verification, making decisions regarding what type of Background Check and License Verification
                        is appropriate, interpreting Background Check and License Verification records once provided by the
                        Background Researcher and displaying information using the Red/Yellow/Green Tiering system described
                        in this Policy, including determining whether a Service Professional is eligible to provide Sensitive

                        offered via its Service constitute Sensitive Services.

                            a) Service Professionals will be notified at the time they indicate their intent to provide Sensitive Services that they

                            Authorized Initiator. All Background Checks will be conducted by a third party service provider

                            provide Pre-Adverse Action Notices and/or Adverse Actions Notices as may be required below, and
                            will make the final determination as to the Red/Yellow/Green Tier assigned to the Service Professional
                            on the Service Professional&#8217;s profile page. If a Service Professional receives a Red Tier
                            rating, the Service Professional may not offer to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics
                            Service. The Service Professional may, however, offer to provide non-Sensitive Services via the

                            Services unless that Service Professional has passed a Background Check with satisfactory results.
                            If the Service Professional attempts to create a listing offering to provide Sensitive Services
                            without having undergone a Background Check, the Loconomics online Service will not permit the
                            Service Professional to create this listing and will instruct the Service Professional as to
                            the Background Check requirement. If the Service Professional attempts to add a category of Sensitive

                            block the Service Professional from offering these Sensitive Services via the Loconomics online

                    <p>
                        If a Service Professional is not required to undergo a Background Check as described in Section 3, the Service Professional
                        may voluntarily choose to complete a Background Check. Background Checks may be required for Service
                        Professionals at the discretion of Loconomics for any Service Professional or position not otherwise
                        defined herein for any reason and at any time. In the event that a discretionary Background Check
                        is carried out, the Service Professional may choose to withdraw as a Service Professional from Loconomics
                        if the Service Professional does not wish to undergo or share results of a Background Check. If the
                        Service Professional opts to the complete the Background Check, Loconomics shall publicly post the
                        results of the Background Check in summary form, utilizing the &#8220;Red/Yellow/Green&#8221; tiering
                        system described below in order to provide Clients information upon which to make informed decisions.
                        In no event shall Loconomics post specific information regarding the results of the Background Check
                        (e.g., Loconomics shall not post any information about specific offenses committed or the particular
                        type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider the Service Professional&#8217;s privacy
                        at all times when posting the results of the Background Check.

                                Professional should be assigned the ranking of Red Tier (meaning that the Service Professional
                                is prohibited from offering Sensitive Services), Yellow Tier (meaning that the Service Professional

                                such services is below average), or Green Tier (meaning that the Service Professional&#8217;s
                                Background Check showed no indication that the Service Professional is unsuitable to offer
                                Sensitive Services).

                            resulted in pending criminal charges. In such circumstances, Loconomics will contact the Service
                            Professional, and may contact other parties to obtain further information in order to assess
                            reliability of the charge information. Loconomics will consider any information revealed regarding
                            convictions, although a Conviction (defined as a guilty verdict, a guilty plea, or a pleas of
                            Nolo Contendere of felony or misdemeanor, other than minor traffic offenses) shall not automatically
                            preclude the individual from offering Sensitive Services or obtaining a &#8220;Green Tier&#8221;

                            the Authorized Initiator shall assign the Service Professional a Red, Yellow, or Green Tier ranking.
                            If a &#8220;Yellow Tier&#8221; or &#8220;Red Tier&#8221; ranking is assigned, Loconomics shall

                            known to Business Associate. Business Associate will provide such notification to Covered Entity

                                    Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, data aggregation services means the combining
                                    of Protected Health Information by Business Associate with the protected health information
                                    received by Business Associate in its capacity as a business associate of another covered

                            required or permitted by applicable law. Business Associate will implement administrative, physical,

                            and availability of any Electronic Protected Health Information that it creates, receives, maintains,

                    <h3>No Third Parties.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Except as expressly stated herein or within the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, the Parties to this Agreement do not intend
                        to create any rights in any third parties.

                    <h3>Entire Agreement, Amendments, Assignment, Relationship, Waiver, Governing Law.</h3>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties in connection with the subject matter herein and this Agreement
                        may be amended or modified only in a writing signed by the Parties. Either party may assign, sublicense,
                        delegate or transfer all or any portion of its rights or responsibilities under this Agreement by
                        operation of law or otherwise to any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, or to any other party, in
                        connection with a sale of the business related to this Agreement or to the Arrangement Agreement.
                        Any assignment of this Agreement by Business Associate in connection with a sale of this business
                        shall relieve Business Associate from any further liability hereunder. None of the provisions of
                        this Agreement are intended to create, nor will they be deemed to create any relationship between
                        the Parties other than that of independent parties contracting with each other solely for the purposes
                        of effecting the provisions of this Agreement and any other agreements between the Parties evidencing
                        their business relationship. This Agreement will be governed by California law, without regard to
                        its choice of law provisions. No change, waiver or discharge of any liability or obligation hereunder
                        on any one or more occasions shall be deemed a waiver of performance of any continuing or other obligation,
                        or shall prohibit enforcement of any obligation, on any other occasion. In the event that any provision
                        of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                        remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. In addition,
                        in the event a Party believes in good faith that any provision of this Agreement fails to comply
                        with the then-current requirements of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including any then-current
                        requirements of the HITECH Act or its regulations, such Party shall notify the other Party in writing.
                        For a period of up to thirty (30) days, the Parties shall address in good faith such concern and
                        amend the terms of this Agreement, if necessary to bring it into compliance. If, after such thirty
                        (30)-day period, the Agreement fails to comply with the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including
                        the HITECH Act, then either Party has the right to terminate upon written notice to the other Party.

                    <h3>Minimum Requirements.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Parties agree that, in the event that any documentation of the Arrangement Agreement pursuant to which Business Associate
                        provides services to Covered Entity contains provisions relating to the use or disclosure of Protected
                        Health Information that are more restrictive than the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
                        of the more restrictive documentation will control. The provisions of this Agreement are intended
                        to establish the minimum requirements regarding the Parties&#8217; use and disclosure of Protected
                        Health Information.
